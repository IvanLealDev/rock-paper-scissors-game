## Description
> This project is an interactive Rock, Paper & Scissors game developed with Next.js and React. It uses TypeScript for improved code typing and Tailwind CSS for interface design and styling.

> It also implements Framer Motion for smooth animations and Lucid-React for icons. The game allows users to play against the computer, displaying both players' choices, keeping track of scores, and providing visual feedback on the outcome of each game. It also features a ShadCN/UI-based theming system, allowing for a responsive user experience.
